<h2>What is Irritable Bowel Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects the large intestine. Symptoms include abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, gas, and diarrhea or constipation, or both. The cause of IBS is unknown, but it may be related to problems with how the muscles in the gut contract and relax, changes in the gut bacteria, or sensitivities to certain foods or stress.</p>
