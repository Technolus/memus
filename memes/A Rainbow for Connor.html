         <p>Connor Hellfire, the king of emotionally charged pencil drawings and sober oil paintings, is here to grace us with his talent.</p>
         <p>And as if that wasn't enough, he's also got some serious self-portrait skills, making him the non-cubist Picasso of our time. I mean, who needs to go to a museum when you can just stare at yourself all day, right Connor?</p>
         <p>But in all seriousness, we can't wait to see what this guy creates next. Just don't forget us little people when you're a big shot, okay?</p>
