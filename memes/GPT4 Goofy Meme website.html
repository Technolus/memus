<!--
As an expert programmer playing in your free time:
Create a silly meme website. The website should contain meme pictures (use urls pointing to those pics), and should be really quirky and laughable. Play with the aesthetics and puns, and make the humor modern and suitable for reddit and discord and crouds from 18-23.
Make it into a single html file so that I can copy paste.

....
First attempt was full of images pointing to non-existant links with puns about programming, so... additional prompt:


Not good enough, needs to be more goofy and relly on its own humor rather than images. It should also be much more flamboyant. Make it hyper extravagant and the humor should be for the average edgy kid not for programmers
