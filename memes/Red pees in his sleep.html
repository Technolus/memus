        <h2>Why Rollthered Pees in His Nightmares</h2>
        <p>Rollthered's nightmares often involve situations where he desperately needs to use the bathroom, but cannot find one or is prevented from doing so by some obstacle. This triggers his anxiety and ultimately leads to him wetting the bed in real life.</p>
        <p>To overcome this problem, Rollthered has started seeking help from a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders. He has also made changes to his bedtime routine, such as avoiding caffeine and drinking less water before going to sleep.</p>
